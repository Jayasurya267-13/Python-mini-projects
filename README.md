## 📌 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Number Guessing Game

**File:** `number_guesssing_game.py`

A simple interactive game where:

* The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
* The user keeps guessing until the correct number is found.
* Helpful hints like *"Too high"* or *"Too low"* guide the user.
* Input validation prevents crashes from invalid entries.

**Concepts used:**

* Random number generation
* `while` loops
* Exception handling (`try-except`)
* User input

### 2️⃣ Palindrome Checker

**File:** `palindrome.py`

This program checks whether a word or phrase is a palindrome.

* Ignores spaces, punctuation, and letter casing.
* Allows repeated checks until the user types `exit`.

**Concepts used:**

* String manipulation
* Functions
* List comprehension
* Loop control

**Example:**

```
Input: Madam
Output: It's a palindrome! ✅
```
